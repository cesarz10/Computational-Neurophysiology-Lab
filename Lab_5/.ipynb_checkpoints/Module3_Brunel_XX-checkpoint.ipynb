    "We will show that a large network of neurons consisting of a group of excitatory and a group of inhibitory neurons that receive external input is capable of producing a rich dynamics. The parameters that we will vary to trigger different states are (1) the driving frequency of the external population and (2) the relative strength of inhibition vs excitation (g). \n",

    "To do so, we will follow two strategies both relying on the BRIAN package: the first strategy is to create our own network from scratch. This will allow you to get acquainted with the BRIAN package and will prepare you for the second strategy. Here, you will use a pre-defined spiking network (included in the BRIAN package), but you will have to make sure you understand its input and outputs in order to induce the correct behaviour. \n"
